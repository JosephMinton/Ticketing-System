# Ticketing-System
A hands-on use case demonstrating how I track, manage, and resolve user issues using a ticketing system.

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab simulates a Tier 1 IT help desk ticketing workflow, focusing on proper ticket creation, documentation, prioritization, escalation, and closure. Scenarios include well-written and poorly written user tickets to practice identifying missing information, improving clarity, and applying appropriate resolution and escalation procedures. The lab emphasizes real-world help desk fundamentals such as user communication, incident management, and clean handoff to specialized teams.
<br />

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Develop practical understanding of a Tier 1 IT help desk ticket lifecycle, from initial intake through documentation, escalation, and closure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice creating and categorizing tickets using clear, actionable subject lines and descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Apply basic prioritization and documentation standards.</li>
<li><strong>Roleplay an interaction with a user who has a vague reported issue.</li>
<li><strong>Determine when escalation is required and document relevant troubleshooting details for handoff to specialized teams.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

<p>Spiceworks</p>
<p><strong>For this at home lab, I used Spiceworks Cloud Help Desk which is a cloud-based ticketing system designed specifically for IT professionals and small to medium-sized businesses.</p>

A simulated help desk ticket was created using standard ticket fields, including subject, issue description, category, priority, and attachments. The goal was to practice documenting user reported issues clearly and categorizing them accurately to support efficient troubleshooting and routing.

<h2>II. Documentation Quality and Clarity</h2>
<p>The original ticket was rewritten using a vague subject and minimal description to simulate a poorly submitted end-user request. This exercise highlighted common documentation issues such as lack of detail, unclear symptoms, and missing context, and demonstrated how vague tickets can slow down troubleshooting and resolution.

Roleplay scenarios were used to represent typical executive-level or non-technical user submissions.</p>

<h2>III. Ticket Resolution and Closure</h2>
<p>A ticket resolution checklist was followed to ensure proper closure. This included confirming the issue was resolved with the user, updating ticket notes with relevant actions taken, and closing the ticket using an appropriate resolution code. Emphasis was placed on clear documentation and user communication prior to closure.</p>

<h2>IV. Escalation Practice</h2>
<p>An escalation scenario was simulated involving a user unable to access a financial database after basic troubleshooting steps were completed. This activity focused on identifying when escalation is necessary, determining the appropriate team to escalate to, and documenting all relevant information needed for an effective handoff, including prior troubleshooting actions and observed symptoms.</p>
