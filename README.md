# Ticketing System Lab
A hands-on use case demonstrating how I track, manage, and resolve user issues using a ticketing system.

<h2>Description</h2>
This lab simulates a Tier 1 IT help desk ticketing workflow, focusing on proper ticket creation, documentation, prioritization, escalation, and closure. Scenarios include well-written and poorly written user tickets to practice identifying missing information, improving clarity, and applying appropriate resolution and escalation procedures. The lab emphasizes real-world help desk fundamentals such as user communication, incident management, and clean handoff to specialized teams.
<br />

<h2>Objective</h2>

<p>Develop practical understanding of a Tier 1 IT help desk ticket lifecycle, from initial intake through documentation, escalation, and closure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Practice creating and categorizing tickets using clear, actionable subject lines and descriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Apply basic prioritization and documentation standards.</li>
<li><strong>Roleplay an interaction with a user who has a vague reported issue.</li>
<li><strong>Determine when escalation is required and document relevant troubleshooting details for handoff to specialized teams.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

<h1>I. Ticket Creation and Categorization</h1><br/>
 <p>Created simulated tickets using standard fields: subject, issue description, category, priority, and attachments. This activity practiced documenting issues clearly and categorizing them accurately to support efficient troubleshooting and routing.</p>

<h1>II. Documentation Quality and Clarity</h1>

<p>Created a vague ticket to simulate a poorly submitted end-user request:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Original Subject: “My internet isn’t working”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Original Description: “I can’t browse the internet and send emails”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p></p>This highlighted common issues: lack of detail, unclear symptoms, and missing context. Roleplay scenarios represented typical non-technical users and executive-level submissions to emphasize real-world ticket clarity requirements.</p>

Roleplay scenarios were used to represent typical executive-level or non-technical user submissions.</p>

<h1>III. Ticket Resolution and Closure</h1>

<p>Followed a resolution checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Confirmed resolution with the user</strong></li>
<li><strong>Updated ticket notes with actions taken</strong></li>
<li><strong>Closed the ticket with the proper resolution code</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Emphasis was placed on user communication and maintaining clear documentation throughout the closure process.</p>

<br />

<h1>IV. Escalation Practice</h1>
<p>Simulated a scenario where a user could not access a financial database after basic troubleshooting (password reset, network checks). Tasks included:
<ul>
<li><strong>Identifying when escalation was needed</li>
<li><strong>Determining the correct team (e.g., Database Admins)</li>
<li><strong>Documenting all relevant troubleshooting steps and findings for handoff</li>
</ul>
Tickets were escalated by assigning them to the appropriate higher-tier team, following proper incident management procedures.</p>

 <br/>
 By assigning the ticket to another specific higher tier, the ticket would be escalated.<br/>

<h1>Key Takeaways</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear and complete ticket documentation reduces resolution time and supports SLA adherence.</li>
<li><strong>Proper categorization and prioritization support smooth ticket workflow</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing when to escalate and documenting prior actions ensures effective handoff, following the IT ticket lifecycle.</li>
<li><strong>Communication with users throughout the ticket lifecycle is essential for service quality</li>
